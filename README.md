# OpenAI-chatgpt-console-app
This project will help you simulate a mock chatgpt AI bot in a console application

- In this project we will be using the OpenAI API, to send a request with your desired prompt message and in response we will get a response from the OpenAI's open source API.
- I have created this project in .NET 6 so please change your code accordingly if you're using any other framework

PROJECT PREREQUISITES:

1. Create a console app project in a solution in visual studio
2. You also need an API Key assigned to you by OpenAI
(link to generate the API Key : https://elephas.app/blog/how-to-create-openai-api-keys-cl5c4f21d281431po7k8fgyol0)
